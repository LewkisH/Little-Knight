## About
A little platformer game made in vanilla Javascript without using canvas that runs on a simple go server.

Levels are generated by reading a bitmap and assigning each pixel as a block or entity in the game world.

The block textures are assigned procedurally by looking at adjacent blocks and block types

## Controls
WASD to move, Space can also be used as a jump key.

Esc to pause/unpause
